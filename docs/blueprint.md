- Transaction Management: Incorporate dynamic fee estimation using EIP-1559 for predictable gas costs, and implement transaction nonce synchronization to prevent replay attacks, enhancing transaction reliability.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant, energetic blue (#29ABE2) reminiscent of the Avalanche brand to inspire confidence in the platform. It represents trust, security, and clarity in financial transactions. 
- Background color: A very light blue (#E5F6FD) that is gentle on the eyes and provides a clean, professional backdrop.
- Accent color: A complementary, warmer hue like a subtle yellow (#F4D35E) for interactive elements to draw the user's attention to key actions.
- Clean, modern fonts optimized for voice command input and transaction data display.
- Use clear and intuitive icons representing various transaction types and wallet functions.
- The layout will incorporate elements to aid usability in a 'heads up' environment where users may not be looking directly at the screen while interacting.
